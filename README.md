# ECLAIR
Robust and scalable inference of cell lineages from gene expression data.

ECLAIR achieves a higher level of confidence in the estimated lineages through the use of approximation algorithms for consensus clustering and by combining the information from an ensemble of minimum spanning trees so as to come up with a better aggregated lineage tree. 

In addition, the present package features several customized algorithms for assessing the similarity between weighted graphs or unrooted trees and for estimating the reproducibility of each edge to a given tree.
