"""ECLAIR is a package for the robust and scalable 
inference of cell lineages from gene expression data.

ECLAIR achieves a higher level of confidence in the estimated lineages 
through the use of approximation algorithms for consensus clustering and by combining the information from an ensemble of minimum spanning trees 
so as to come up with an improved, aggregated lineage tree. 

In addition, the present package features several customized algorithms for assessing the similarity between weighted graphs or unrooted trees and for estimating the reproducibility of each edge to a given tree.
